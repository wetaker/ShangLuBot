# ShangLuBot
A fun little bot to see how long it has been since esteemed McGill Division I Esports top laner has played a ranked game.

# Usage

# How it works
Scrapes match data from op.gg (statically so if there are no ranked games played in the last 20 games we will fail) and then sends a message saying how long it has been with different emojis depending on the time. 

# Why does it only support Shang Lu
The data is scraped so if support was increased and more people tried to use it. OPGG would ban us : [
